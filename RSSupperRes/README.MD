# RS Super-Resolution
* The model upsamples the images from rougher spatial resolution to finer. 
## Intuition
The model consists of three main parts: feature extractor, feature selector, image reconstructor. The model input is the low-resolutionn image, and target is the residual between true high-resolution image and bicubic upsampled image. In the forward pass, <br>
1. the input image is first digested by feature extractor that creates a stack of feature maps at different spatial scales <br>
2. the feature selector working on feature stack to select responsible feature maps <br>
3. the selected feature maps are reassembled to form the target image (residual image)

## Current available models
1. 2x resolution upsampling consists of:
> a 9-layer feature extractor with number of filters [128-108-84-65-54-49-48-48-48]
> a 3-path inception feature selector with number of filters [64-32-32]
> a 1-layer image reconstructor with number of filters [24]
