## [RSSuperRes - Super resolution model for upsampling RS imagery](https://github.com/ramenwang/earth-analytics/tree/master/RSSupperRes)

An application of upsampling RS imagery based on deep learning CNN. The script is writen in python mainly based on Keras library, and the model is trained on Google Colab.

## [MODIS LST - python scripts for downloading, preprocessing, and value extraction](https://github.com/ramenwang/earth-analytics/tree/master/MODIS_LST)

Built on top of [pyModis](http://www.pymodis.org/) and [pyMasker](https://pypi.org/project/pymasker/), most of the credentials should go to the original authors. 

## [General tools for RS image processing](https://github.com/ramenwang/earth-analytics/tree/master/general_tools)

This folder are hand crafted tools for the convinience of processing RS imagery data in python environment. It requires some python packages to be installed: rasterio, gdal, earthpy and matplotlib


## [Python tools for computing drought indicator](https://github.com/ramenwang/earth-analytics/tree/master/drought_indicator)

A collection of drought indicators across different domains, including meteorology, remote sensing, GIS, agriculture, etc.


## [2020 corn yield estimation](https://github.com/ramenwang/earth-analytics/tree/master/2020_corn_yield_prediction)

A project to predict 2020 national corn yield based on FIPS-level weather data from 2010.1 to 2020.3
